# Slash Commands Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The slash command feature has been successfully implemented according to the design specification. Users can now invoke commands directly in the chat using `/command` syntax instead of navigating through the Ctrl+K dialog.

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Core Components Created

1. **SlashCommandProcessor** (`internal/tui/components/dialog/slash_commands.go`)
   - Parses slash command input (`/command remaining text`)
   - Resolves commands with fallback precedence (direct → user: → project:)
   - Concatenates command content with user prompt
   - Handles named arguments detection
   - Provides comprehensive error handling

2. **Enhanced Command Structure** (`internal/tui/components/dialog/commands.go`)
   - Added `Content` field to store raw command file content
   - Enables direct access to command content for slash processing

3. **Chat Page Integration** (`internal/tui/page/chat.go`)
   - Intercepts input in `sendMessage()` to detect slash commands
   - Added `CommandSetter` interface for command passing
   - Integrated argument dialog support for commands with named parameters
   - Added validation and error handling

4. **Main TUI Integration** (`internal/tui/tui.go`)
   - Passes loaded commands to chat page during initialization
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing Ctrl+K workflow

### Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Command Detection & Parsing
```go
// Detects slash commands and extracts command name + remaining text
/design Create REST API → command: "design", text: "Create REST API"
```

#### ✅ Command Resolution Strategy
1. Direct match: `/design` → `design` command
2. User commands: `/design` → `user:design` command  
3. Project commands: `/design` → `project:design` command

#### ✅ Content Concatenation
```
[Command File Content]

[User Prompt Text]
```

#### ✅ Named Arguments Support
- Detects `$ARGUMENTS` patterns in command content
- Shows argument dialog when needed
- Integrates with existing argument handling system

#### ✅ Error Handling & Validation
- Input syntax validation
- Command not found with helpful suggestions
- Agent busy state checking
- Comprehensive error messaging

#### ✅ Backwards Compatibility
- Ctrl+K dialog remains fully functional
- Existing command files work without changes
- All command directories supported
- No breaking changes to current workflows

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests Created
- `slash_commands_test.go` with comprehensive test coverage
- Command detection validation
- Content concatenation verification
- Error handling scenarios
- Command resolution precedence

### Example Commands Created
- `/design` - System architecture and API design
- `/debug` - Debug and troubleshoot issues  
- `/help` - Slash commands help and usage

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
1. **README.md** - Added slash commands section with examples
2. **docs/slash-commands.md** - Comprehensive documentation
3. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Added `/command` shortcut reference

### Documentation Highlights
- Usage examples and syntax
- Benefits over dialog navigation
- Command resolution explanation
- Integration with existing workflows
- Troubleshooting guide

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
/design Create microservices architecture for e-commerce
/debug Memory leak in cache module
/help
```

### With Prefixes
```bash
/user:custom-template Generate project documentation
/project:deploy Deploy to staging environment
```

### With Named Arguments
Commands containing `$PROJECT_NAME`, `$ENVIRONMENT` etc. automatically show argument dialog before execution.

## 🚀 Implementation Benefits

### Speed & Efficiency
- ⚡ **Instant execution** - No dialog navigation required
- 🎯 **Contextual prompts** - Combine templates with specific needs
- 💬 **Natural flow** - Integrates seamlessly with chat interface

### User Experience
- 🔍 **Familiar syntax** - Similar to Discord, Slack, and other modern tools
- 🔄 **Progressive enhancement** - Works alongside existing features
- 📖 **Discoverable** - Clear error messages and help system

### Technical Quality
- 🏗️ **Clean architecture** - Modular, testable components
- 🔒 **Robust error handling** - Comprehensive validation and feedback
- 🔧 **Maintainable** - Well-documented code with unit tests

## 🔮 Future Enhancements Ready

The implementation provides a solid foundation for planned future features:

- **Phase 2**: Autocomplete, aliases, enhanced help
- **Phase 3**: Template variables, nested commands, parameter parsing  
- **Phase 4**: Command chaining, usage analytics, workspace commands

## ✨ Key Innovation

The slash command system's key innovation is **input interception at the `sendMessage()` level**, allowing natural combination of command templates with user-specific prompts while maintaining complete backwards compatibility with the existing Ctrl+K workflow.

This creates a powerful hybrid approach where users can choose their preferred interaction method while the AI receives rich, contextual prompts that combine structured templates with specific user needs.
