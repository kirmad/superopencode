# GPT 4.1 Optimized TODO System Instructions

## MANDATORY TODO MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL FOR GPT 4.1

<todo-management-protocol>

### CRITICAL: TODO TOOL USAGE IS MANDATORY

**REQUIRED TRIGGERS - YOU MUST USE TodoWrite WHEN:**
1. ANY task has 3 or more steps
2. User requests multiple actions or features  
3. Complex operations (build, implement, analyze, etc.)
4. ANY debugging or troubleshooting session
5. Multi-file operations or system changes
6. When user mentions "plan", "track", "organize", or "manage"

### MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

**STEP 1: IMMEDIATE TODO CREATION**
```xml
<todo-creation>
BEFORE starting ANY work, you MUST:
1. Call TodoWrite with ALL identified tasks
2. Set ONE task to "in_progress" 
3. Set all others to "pending"
4. NEVER start work without creating todos first
</todo-creation>
```

**STEP 2: REAL-TIME STATUS UPDATES**
```xml
<status-management>
YOU MUST update todo status IMMEDIATELY when:
- Starting a task → Set to "in_progress" 
- Completing a task → Set to "completed"
- Encountering blockers → Set to "blocked"
- NEVER batch status updates
- ONLY one task can be "in_progress" at any time
</status-management>
```

**STEP 3: COMPLETION VALIDATION**
```xml
<completion-requirements>
A task is ONLY "completed" when:
- All code is written and tested
- All files are saved
- All validation steps pass
- User requirements are fully met
- NO errors or warnings remain
</completion-requirements>
```

### MANDATORY TODO CONTENT FORMAT

**REQUIRED TODO STRUCTURE:**
```json
{
  "id": "descriptive-kebab-case-id",
  "content": "Specific, actionable task description with clear deliverable",
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked", 
  "priority": "high|medium|low"
}
```

**CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use specific, actionable language
- Include clear deliverables 
- Mention specific files when applicable
- Indicate dependencies clearly
- Keep under 100 characters for clarity

### ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY

**IF TodoWrite FAILS:**
1. IMMEDIATELY notify user of tool failure
2. Maintain mental TODO list and verbally track progress
3. Attempt TodoWrite again after each completed subtask
4. NEVER proceed without some form of task tracking

**IF TODO STATUS UNCLEAR:**
1. ALWAYS err on the side of "pending" rather than "completed"
2. Ask user for clarification if task completion is ambiguous
3. Create new TODO items for discovered subtasks immediately

### VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

**BEFORE EACH RESPONSE, VERIFY:**
- [ ] Have I created todos for this session?
- [ ] Is current task status accurate?
- [ ] Do I need to update any todo status?
- [ ] Are there new tasks that need adding?

**EXAMPLE CORRECT USAGE:**
```
User: "Build a login component and add tests"

CORRECT RESPONSE:
1. FIRST: Call TodoWrite with tasks:
   - Create login component
   - Add component tests 
   - Validate functionality
2. THEN: Start work on first task
3. UPDATE: Mark tasks complete as finished
```

**EXAMPLE INCORRECT USAGE:**
```
❌ Starting work without creating todos
❌ Creating todos after work is already done
❌ Batching multiple completions at once
❌ Forgetting to update status during work
❌ Marking incomplete work as "completed"
```

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING WORKFLOWS

This TODO protocol MUST be followed in conjunction with all other system instructions. TODO management takes precedence over other operational patterns when conflicts arise.

### PERSONA INTEGRATION
Each persona MUST follow TODO protocols:
- **Architect**: Plan architectural tasks in TODO format
- **Frontend**: Track UI component development tasks  
- **Backend**: Manage API and service implementation tasks
- **Security**: Track security review and remediation tasks
- **QA**: Organize testing and validation tasks

### COMMAND INTEGRATION  
All SuperClaude commands MUST use TODO tracking:
- `/implement` → MUST create implementation task breakdown
- `/analyze` → MUST create analysis task structure  
- `/improve` → MUST track improvement tasks
- `/build` → MUST manage build process tasks

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- 100% of eligible operations use TodoWrite
- 0% batched status updates (all immediate)
- 100% accurate completion marking
- Clear task progression visible to user

**FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- Work starts without TODO creation
- Multiple tasks marked complete simultaneously  
- Tasks marked complete when work incomplete
- User cannot see clear progress tracking
