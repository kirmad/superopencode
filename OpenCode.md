# PRINCIPLES.md - SuperClaude Framework Core Principles

**Primary Directive**: "Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity"

## Core Philosophy
- **Structured Responses**: Use unified symbol system for clarity and token efficiency
- **Minimal Output**: Answer directly, avoid unnecessary preambles/postambles
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: All claims must be verifiable through testing, metrics, or documentation

# ORCHESTRATOR.md - SuperClaude Intelligent Routing System

Intelligent routing system for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## 🧠 Detection Engine

Analyzes requests to understand intent, complexity, and requirements.

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks

**Resource Validation**:
- Token usage prediction based on operation complexity and scope
- Memory and processing requirements estimation
- File system permissions and available space verification
- MCP server availability and response time checks

**Compatibility Validation**:
- Flag combination conflict detection (e.g., `--no-mcp` with `--seq`)
- Persona + command compatibility verification
- Tool availability for requested operations
- Project structure requirements validation

**Risk Assessment**:
- Operation complexity scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Failure probability based on historical patterns
- Resource exhaustion likelihood prediction
- Cascading failure potential analysis

**Validation Logic**: Resource availability, flag compatibility, risk assessment, outcome prediction, and safety recommendations. Operations with risk scores >0.8 trigger safe mode suggestions.

**Resource Management Thresholds**:
- **Green Zone** (0-60%): Full operations, predictive monitoring active
- **Yellow Zone** (60-75%): Resource optimization, caching, suggest --uc mode
- **Orange Zone** (75-85%): Warning alerts, defer non-critical operations  
- **Red Zone** (85-95%): Force efficiency modes, block resource-intensive operations
- **Critical Zone** (95%+): Emergency protocols, essential operations only

3. Score complexity based on scope and steps
4. Evaluate wave opportunity scoring
5. Estimate resource requirements
6. Generate routing recommendation (traditional vs wave mode)
7. Apply auto-detection triggers for wave activation
```

**Enhanced Wave Detection Algorithm**:
- **Flag Overrides**: `--single-wave` disables, `--force-waves`/`--wave-mode` enables
- **Scoring Factors**: Complexity (0.2-0.4), scale (0.2-0.3), operations (0.2), domains (0.1), flag modifiers (0.05-0.1)
- **Thresholds**: Default 0.7, customizable via `--wave-threshold`, enterprise strategy lowers file thresholds
- **Decision Logic**: Sum all indicators, trigger waves when total ≥ threshold
